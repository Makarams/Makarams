### Who I am

I am a Cambodian software engineer and youth leader, graduated with honors in Computer Science, working at the intersection of technology and society.

I am a trilingual Cambodian youth engaged across technical, diplomatic, and civic spaces, focused on designing systems and initiatives that are inclusive, ethical, and impactful.

### Focus areas

Internet Governance  
I actively engage in youth-led Internet governance initiatives that promote digital inclusion, platform accountability, and open access. Through national, regional, and global forums, I contribute to shaping conversations around ethical technology and a rights-based digital future.

Regional Diplomacy  
As a Cambodian youth representative, I participate in multilateral forums and exchange programs that strengthen ASEAN’s engagement with partner countries including the United States, Australia, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. My work centers on youth diplomacy, leadership, innovation, and regional collaboration.

Community Empowerment  
Over the past few years, I have led and supported more than 20 initiatives spanning charity campaigns, CSR programs, environmental cleanups, education outreach, and national events. These efforts align closely with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly education, environment, and reduced inequalities.

Digital Solutions  
With a strong foundation in software systems and digital problem-solving, I design and implement practical, sustainable, and user-centered technologies that improve public systems and address community challenges, especially in accessibility, equity, and service delivery.
